completed:
- fixed bug in screenshots for some slow websites
- added recording capability
- automatically adding ad text rating to database
- making source url accessible from database (will be used for variable 3)
- played around with scrolling feature and timeouts to try to get runtime for each website to be faster, yet still have ads loading
- mitmproxy dump files

TODO (Iris):

pass mitmdump output to main.py script. don't insert data into db or make screenshots/recordings until mitmdumps are made from crawler (manager file).
once I have the mitmdump file, then I can the replay with something like: mitmdump -nr ./mitmdumps/www.dictionary.com.dump -s main.py
This step should then save images, screenshots, and recordings, along with the corresponding new database data.
    # .venv/bin/mitmdump -nr ./mitmdumps/www.dictionary.com.dump \
    #   -s main.py \
    #   --set my_custom_arg=https://www.dictionary.com/e/all-the-words/

    # mitmdump --listen-port 8082 -w ./mitmdumps/www.dictionary.com.dump
    # curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8082 https://www.dictionary.com/e/all-the-words/ (in other terminal)
    #    Can also try using browser to visit site with proxy settings on. See if this makes images get saved and loaded.
    # in mitmdump terminal, Ctrl+C
